INTRODUCTION

Very is a simple, high-performance functional language intended for web
development. It's a dynamically typed, concatenative, lazy language with
homoiconic syntax and a powerful macro system, closely related to Forth and
Lisp. It provides convenient tools for generating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
other content.
